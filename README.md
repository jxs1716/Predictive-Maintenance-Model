# Predictive-Maintenance-Model
This dataset (10,000 samples, 14 features) simulates real-world predictive maintenance. It helps you develop models to identify potential machine failures based on sensor data (temperature, speed, torque, etc.) before they occur. The dataset includes a "machine failure" label but excludes the specific failure type to prevent misleading models.
